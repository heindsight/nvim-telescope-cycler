*telescope_cycler.nvim*  Cycle through telescope pickers

This plugin provides a mechanism to cycle through a list of telescope picker
configurations.


telescope-cycler.new({pickers}, {opts})               *telescope-cycler.new()*
    Create a new telescope cycler instance.

    Parameters: ~
      • {pickers_cfgs}  (`table[]`) A list of telescope picker configurations.
                        Each element is a table with the following keys:
                        • {name} (`string`) The name that can be used to
                          reference the picker.
                        • {picker} (`function`) A function to launch the picker.
                        • {opts} (`table?`) Options to pass to the picker
                          function. 
      • {mappings}      (`table?`) Keys to map for switching to the next or
                        previous picker. Accepted keys are:
                        • {next} (`string?`) The key to switch to the next
                          picker (default: <C-l>).
                        • {prev} (`string?`) The key to switch to the previous
                          picker (default: <C-n>).
                        Note that the same keys are mapped in both normal and
                        insert mode.

    Return: ~
      • (`function(name: string?)`) A function to launch a picker from the
        `picker_cfgs` list by name. If no name is provided, the first picker
        in the list is launched. The keys configured in `mappings` are mapped
        to switch to the next/previous picker in the list.

    Example: ~
    >lua
        local cycler = telescope_cycler.new(
            {
                {
                    name = "Find files",
                    picker = telescope_builtin.find_files,
                    opts = { hidden = true }
                },
                { name = "Buffers",      picker = telescope_builtin.buffers },
                { name = "Old files", picker = telescope_builtin.oldfiles },
            },
            { next = '<C-n>', prev = '<C-p>' }
        )
        vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>f', cycler, { desc = 'Telescope' })
<
    The above example maps <leader>f to launch telescope with the "Find files"
    picker (with `options` set to `{ hidden = true }`). The <C-n> and <C-p>
    keys will be mapped to switch to the next/previous pickers amongst "Find
    Files", "Buffers", and "Old files".
